# üèéÔ∏è F1 Race Time Prediction with FastF1 + Machine Learning  

This project uses the [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) library and machine learning (Gradient Boosting) to predict F1 race performance based on qualifying results.  

Specifically:
- Trained a model on 2024 Australian GP race data.  
- Telemery data was used from 2025 Chinese GP qualifying times to predict potential race performance.  
- The model outputs predicted lap times and ranks drivers accordingly.
