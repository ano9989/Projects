# üèéÔ∏è F1 Race Time Prediction with FastF1 + Machine Learning  

This project demonstrates how to combine sports analytics with machine learning by predicting F1 race lap times from qualifying results.  

I use the [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) Python library to extract historical Formula 1 race data, then train a Gradient Boosting regression model to estimate race pace for the upcoming 2025 Chinese Grand Prix based on qualifying results.  The model outputs predicted lap times and ranks drivers accordingly.  

The project highlights skills in:
- Data collection & preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature engineering)
- Data analysis (working with time-series race telemetry and lap data)
- Machine learning pipeline development (scikit-learn, model training & evaluation)
- Practical application of ML to a real-world, high-variance sports dataset


# üß† Parkinson's Disease Detection using Random Forest  

This project aims to apply machine learning for healthcare by predicting whether a patient has Parkinson‚Äôs disease based on voice measurement features.  

Using the [UCI Parkinson‚Äôs dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/174/parkinsons), I built a Random Forest Classifier to distinguish between healthy individuals and Parkinson‚Äôs patients.  

The project demonstrates skills in:
- Data preprocessing (scaling, handling biomedical data)  
- Model training & evaluation (Random Forest, scikit-learn pipeline)  
- Model interpretability (confusion matrix visualization)  
- Applying ML to a real-world healthcare dataset
