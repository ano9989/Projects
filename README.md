# üèéÔ∏è F1 Race Time Prediction with FastF1 + Machine Learning  

This project demonstrates how to combine sports analytics with machine learning by predicting F1 race lap times from qualifying results.  

I use the [FastF1](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) Python library to extract historical Formula 1 race data, then train a Gradient Boosting regression model to estimate race pace for the upcoming 2025 Chinese Grand Prix based on qualifying results.  The model outputs predicted lap times and ranks drivers accordingly.  

The project highlights skills in:
- Data collection & preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature engineering)
- Data analysis (working with time-series race telemetry and lap data)
- Machine learning pipeline development (scikit-learn, model training & evaluation)
- Practical application of ML to a real-world, high-variance sports dataset
